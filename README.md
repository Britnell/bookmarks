# Project

## Setup

- create vite
- tailwind
- react router

# TDD

- Web app for saving bookmarks. localStorage is used.
- React router for data loading and pagination
- bookmarks are stored as json with timestamp as id, though since it is made for one user collisions are low, and error checking can be added to increment timestamp until it is unique
